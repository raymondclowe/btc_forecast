## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nixtla/nixtla.git
cd nixtla/experiments/bitcoin-prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up your API key:
```bash
export NIXTLA_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

5. Run tests:
```bash
make test
```

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Keep functions focused and modular

Example:
```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Short description of what the function does.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    param1 : str
        Description of param1
    param2 : int
        Description of param2
        
    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Description of return value
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Testing

Before submitting changes:

1. Run module tests:
```bash
python test_modules.py
```

2. Test your changes with quick analysis:
```bash
python quick_analysis.py
```

3. Verify full analysis still works (if applicable):
```bash
python main.py
```

## Submitting Changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Commit with clear messages:
```bash
git commit -m "Add feature: description"
```

6. Push to your fork:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
