# Bitcoin Prediction - Chart Gallery 📊

This document showcases the easy-to-understand charts available in the Bitcoin prediction toolkit.

## 🌤️ Weather Forecast Tool

The weather forecast tool (`weather_forecast.py` or `make weather`) provides a simple, intuitive outlook for Bitcoin prices.

### Features:
- **7-day outlook** with visual confidence ranges
- **Daily predictions** with trend indicators (📈 up, 📉 down, ➡️ flat)
- **Directional probability** showing up vs down percentage
- **Uncertainty levels** with traffic light indicators (🟢🟡🔴)
- **Easy-to-read format** similar to weather forecasts

### Usage:
```bash
make weather
# or
python weather_forecast.py
```

**Output:**
- `results/bitcoin_weather_forecast.png` - Main weather-style chart
- `results/bitcoin_simple_outlook.png` - Simple bar chart with ranges

## 📊 Performance Scorecard

An at-a-glance performance assessment across all backtesting periods.

### Features:
- **MAPE Comparison**: Color-coded bars (Green=Excellent <10%, Orange=Good <20%, Red=Poor >20%)
- **Directional Accuracy**: Shows accuracy vs random baseline (50%)
- **Confidence Coverage**: Validates that 80%/95% intervals work as expected
- **Overall Rating**: Star-based rating system (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- **Key Insights**: Summary with actionable recommendations

### Generated by:
- `main.py` - Creates `results/performance_scorecard.png`
- Shows comparison across all backtesting periods

**What to look for:**
- Green bars in MAPE = Excellent predictions
- Directional accuracy > 55% = Better than random
- Coverage close to interval level = Well-calibrated

## 🎯 Simple Performance Summary

Color-coded visualization showing prediction quality at a glance.

### Features:
- **Color-coded scatter plot**: 
  - 🟢 Green dots = Accurate predictions (<5% error)
  - 🔴 Red dots = Inaccurate predictions (>5% error)
- **Win rate pie chart**: Overall success rate
- **Average vs Median error**: Typical error range
- **Error categories**: Breakdown (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)

### Generated by:
- `main.py` - Creates `results/simple_summary_{period}.png` for each period
- `quick_analysis.py` - Creates `results/quick_simple_summary.png`

**What to look for:**
- More green dots = Better performance
- Win rate > 50% = More predictions under 5% error
- Error categories mostly in "Excellent" and "Good" = Strong model

---

## 📈 Forecast vs Actual

Traditional chart showing predicted vs actual prices with confidence intervals.

### Features:
- **Actual prices** (solid line)
- **Predicted prices** (dashed line)
- **80% confidence interval** (darker shading)
- **95% confidence interval** (lighter shading)
- **Clear separation** of historical data and forecast period

### Generated by:
- All analysis scripts
- Shows how well predictions match reality

**What to look for:**
- Predictions close to actual = Good accuracy
- Actual values within confidence bands = Well-calibrated intervals
- Narrower bands = More certain predictions

---

## 📊 Bar Charts with Uncertainty

Simple bar charts showing daily forecasts with error bars.

### Features:
- **Color-coded bars**:
  - 🟢 Green = Price going up
  - 🔴 Red = Price going down
- **Error bars** showing 80% confidence range
- **Current price line** for reference
- **Easy-to-read format**

### Generated by:
- `weather_forecast.py` - Creates `results/bitcoin_simple_outlook.png`

**What to look for:**
- Direction and magnitude of daily changes
- Size of error bars (larger = more uncertainty)
- Overall trend (mostly green = upward, mostly red = downward)

## 🎨 Chart Design Principles

All charts follow these principles for maximum clarity:

1. **Color Coding**: Consistent across all charts
   - 🟢 Green = Good/Up/Accurate
   - 🔴 Red = Poor/Down/Inaccurate
   - 🟡 Orange = Moderate/Warning
   - 🔵 Blue = Reference/Current

2. **Annotations**: Key insights highlighted directly on charts

3. **Traffic Lights**: Visual indicators (🟢🟡🔴) for quick assessment

4. **Emojis**: Trend indicators (📈📉➡️) for immediate understanding

5. **Large Text**: Easy to read, bold where important

6. **Clear Legends**: Every element explained

## 💡 Tips for Interpretation

### For Non-Technical Users:
- **Green is good, red is bad** - Simple rule of thumb
- **Look at the overall rating** in the scorecard first
- **Check the win rate** in the simple summary
- **Focus on the weather forecast** for daily decisions

### For Trading:
- **Directional accuracy >55%** can be used for signals
- **Use confidence intervals** for stop-loss placement
- **Check error categories** - aim for mostly "Excellent" and "Good"
- **Compare across periods** to see which market conditions work best

### For Risk Management:
- **Wider error bars** = use tighter position sizing
- **Lower confidence coverage** = intervals may be unreliable
- **High MAPE** = focus on ranges rather than point estimates
